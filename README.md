Simon is a test of memory and reflexes. The game consists of a sequence of colored buttons that light up in a specific order. The player must then replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. With each successful round, the sequence becomes one step longer, making it more challenging.
Start the game.
The game will display a sequence of lights and sounds by activating the colored buttons in a random order.
Once the sequence is complete, it's the player's turn. Press the buttons in the exact same order they lit up.
If the player presses the buttons correctly, the game progresses to the next round with a longer sequence.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and the player's score is displayed.
